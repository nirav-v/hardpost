## <h2 align="center"> An online marketplace to buy, sell, and trade skateboarding items. </h2>

### <p align="center"> [deployed site](https://hardpost-f79ecee5b44d.herokuapp.com/) </p>

## <p align="center">Motivation

The prices of skateboarding hard-goods are at an all time high. Skateboarders typically accumulate lots of gear while many people cannot afford to buy those items brand new. There is no dedicated platform for people to specifically buy or sell skateboarding items from other individuals at a more affordable price. The main option has been to go on generic online marketplaces where the majority of users have no interest in skateboarding products. Hardpost aims to close that gap.

## <p align="center">Description

The concept is straightforward. Skateboarders can create and account and make posts of items they have for sale, including an image and price tag. Other users can browse those items, add them to their cart, and then must be logged in with an account to purchase those items.
